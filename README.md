## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js >= 18
- Firebase project with Firestore and Authentication enabled
- Google Gemini API key
- Azure Text-To-Speech (TTS) API key

### Environment Variables
Create a ```.env``` file in your project root:
```bash
# Firebase Admin
FIREBASE_TYPE=service_account
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY_ID=your_private_key_id
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY="your_private_key"
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=your_client_email
FIREBASE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
FIREBASE_AUTH_URI=https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth
FIREBASE_TOKEN_URI=https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token
FIREBASE_AUTH_PROVIDER_CERT_URL=https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs
FIREBASE_CLIENT_CERT_URL=your_client_cert_url

# Google Gemini
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key

# Azure TTS
AZURE_TTS_KEY=your_azure_tts_key
AZURE_TTS_REGION=your_azure_region
```

Note: Ensure FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY preserves newline characters. You may need .replace(/\\n/g, '\n') when loading in code.

### Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### Run Locally
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

The app should now be available at ```http://localhost:3000```.

## AI Interaction Flow
1. User submits a message.
2. Sentiment analysis API evaluates emotional tone.
3. Gemini API generates a response using the custom STAR feedback prompt.
4. Response is stored in Firestore under the current interview session.
5. Audio TTS is generated if voice output is enabled.


---


## Limitations / Known Issues
- AI feedback may sometimes misinterpret context or nuances in responses.
- Voice recognition (voice input) accuracy depends on background noise and microphone quality.
- Resume parsing may miss formatting details in complex PDF layouts. On some deployments, resume processing may not work properly even if it works locally.
- Internet connection is required for all AI and Text-To-Speech services.
- Free API quotas may limit usage during extended testing.
